## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5

### What I learned

- I learned a lot about the thought process of creating complex website layouts but still a long way to go and I found this challenge perfect for practicing layouts 
- Bootstrap 5 helped me make things responsive as I still have trouble wrapping my head around min vs. max widths, and proper responsive layout techniques
- CSS is really complex and made me want to use SASS because of this challenge.

### Continued development

- This challenge made me realize that I need to improve my use of media queries and to do a lot more of css variables as it could really help on reducing the amount of changes I need to modify.
- This solution was supposed to be made with JS but I still need to learn more about it so I had to use Bootstrap 5, will update this after I can confidently use JS

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me grasp the css variable, flexbox, and css grid. A really good website for beginners like me.  
- [Bootstrap 5 Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - I just followed this documentation without relying much on videos, it helps you be more creative
