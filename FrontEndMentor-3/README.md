### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned


### Continued development

This challenge made me realize that I need to improve my use of media queries and to do a lot more of css variables as it could really help on reducing the amount of changes I need to modify.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me grasp the css variable, flexbox, and css grid. A really good website for beginners like me.
